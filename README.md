* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Local Deployment commands

* `make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipies create-mdai`              deploy a local cluster from scratch
* `make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipies delete-mdai`             deletes mdai cluster deployed locally and all artifacts associated
* `make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipies delete-mdai-all`             deletes mdai cluster deployed locally and all artifacts associated, plus helm charts
* `make -f ./make/Makefile-local-recipies update-mdai-collector`              updates mdai the collector to the latest configuration
